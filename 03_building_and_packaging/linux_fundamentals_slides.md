# Some Fundamentals of Linux Systems

---

## Introduction

- Common functionality should not be redone.
    - Examples: [C++ Standard Library](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp), [Python Standard Library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/), [PETSc](https://petsc.org/), [FEniCS](https://fenicsproject.org/)...
- For reusing software we need to know
    - ... where the software is located.
    - ... how to compile and link with/against.

---

## Learning Goals of This Unit

- Explain the difference between static and shared linking.
- Have an overview over common file system structure on Linux.
- Know about commonly used environment variables, how to interact with them, and how to use them.

---

## Static and Shared Linking

- Static
    - Self-contained (no external dependency)
    - Larger library/executable
    - Libraries: `libName.a`
- Shared
    - Has runtime dependencies
    - Executables can share library in memory
    - Libraries: `libName.so`

---

## Demo Static and Shared Linking

---

## Filesystem Hierarchy Standard

- Defines filesystem layout on Linux

- Often symbolic links between 1st and 2nd hierarchy: `bin -> usr/bin`
- [Official homepage of FHS](https://refspecs.linuxfoundation.org/fhs.shtml)

---

## Some Environment Variables

- `HOME` or `~`: User's home directory
- `PWD`: Current working directory
- `PATH`: Locations of executables on system
- `LC_<NAME>`: [Locales](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/locale)
- `LANG`: Systems' language
- System variables often set from `/etc/profile` and `/etc/bashrc` or `/etc/bash.bashrc`

---

## Manipulating Environment Variables 1/2

- Show content of variables via

  ```bash
  echo $VARIABLE
  printenv VARIABLE
  ```

- Setting variable for a single command (bash)

  ```bash
  VARIABLE=VALUE ./COMMAND
  ```

- Setting **environment** variable

  ```bash
  export ENV_VARIABLE=VALUE
  ```

---

## Manipulating Environment Variables 2/2

- Adding additional values by colon (`:`) separated list

  Example:

  ```bash
  PATH=/home/uekermbn/bin:${PATH}
  ```

- Extra paths of user often set in `${HOME}/.bashrc`, `${HOME}/.bash_exports`,...

---

## Demo Environment Variables

---

## Some Environment Variables (C++)

- `LD_<NAME>`: Library loader related variable
    - `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`: Library paths for runtime
- `LIBRARY_PATH`: Library path for compilation (linker)
- `CPATH`, `C_INCLUDE_PATH`, `CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH`: Include file path
- Names can vary between OS, software

---

## Paths and Environment Variables (Python)

- System-wide and user-specific

- `PYTHONPATH`: Environment variable for non-standard installation of modules/packages
    - Points to `prefix/lib/pythonX.Y/site-packages`
