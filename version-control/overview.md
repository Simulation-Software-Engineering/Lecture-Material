# Git -- the standard version control system

Learning goals:

- Refresh and organize students' existing knowledge on git (learn how to learn more).
- Students can explain difference between merge and rebase and when to use what.
- How to use git workflows to organize research software development in a team.
- Get to know a few useful GitHub/GitLab standards and a few helpful tools.

## Introduction to version control

## Recap of Git basics

Duration: 15 mins
Format: poll, picture, demo

| Duration | Format |
| --- | --- |
| 15 minutes | poll, picture, demo |

- Expert level poll on git: ask students to estimate their level.
  - Beginner: I have hardly ever used Git
  - User: pull, commit, push, status, diff
  - Developer: fork, branch, merge, checkout
  - Maintainer: rebase, squash, cherry-pick, bisect
  - Owner: submodules

![git overview picture from py-rse](https://merely-useful.tech/py-rse/figures/git-cmdline/git-remote.png)

- `git --help`, `git commit --help`
- incomplete statement `git comm`

- There is a difference between Git and hosting services ([*forges*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forge_(software)))
  - [GitHub](https://github.com/)
  - [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/), open-source, hosted e.g. at [IPVS](https://gitlab-sim.informatik.uni-stuttgart.de)
  - [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/product/)
  - [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/)
  - many more
  - often, more than just hosting, also DevOps

- Give outlook on remainder of Git chapter: *How I work with Git*, quiz, advanced topics (workflows, rebase, standards), *my neat little Git trick*

## How I work with Git

| Duration | Format |
| --- | --- |
| 40 minutes | demo |

Starting remarks:

- There is not *the one solution* how to do things with Git. I simply show what I typically use.
- Don't use a client if you don't understand the command line `git`

- (1) Look at GitHub
  - [preCICE repository](https://github.com/precice/precice)
  - default branch `develop`
  - fork -> my fork

- (2) Working directory:
  - ZSH shell shows git branches
  - `git remote -v` (I have upstream, myfork, ...)
  - mention difference between ssh and https (also see GitHub)
  - get newest changes `git pull upstream develop`
  - `git log` -> I use special format, see `~/.gitconfig`,
  - check log on GitHub; explain short hash
  - `git branch`
  - `git branch add-demo-feature`
  - `git checkout add-demo-feature`

- (3) First commit
  - `git status` -> always tells you what you can do
  - `vi src/action/Action.hpp` -> add `#include "MagicHeader.hpp"`
  - `git diff`, `git diff src/com/Action.hpp`, `git diff --color-words`
  - `git status`, `git add`, `git status`
  - `git commit` -> "Include MagicHeader in Action.hpp"
  - `git status`, `git log`, `git log -p`, `git show`

- (4) Change or revert things
  - I forgot to add sth: `git reset --soft HEAD~1`, `git status`
  - `git diff`, `git diff HEAD` because already staged
  - `git log`
  - `git commit`
  - actually all that is nonsense: `git reset --hard HEAD~1`
  - modify again, all nonsense before committing: `git checkout src/action/Action.hpp`

- (5) Stash
  - while working on unfinished feature, I need to change / test this other thing quickly, too lazy for commits / branches
  - `git stash`
  - `git stash pop`

- (6) Create PR
  - create commit again
  - preview what will be in PR: `git diff develop..add-demo-feature`
  - `git push -u myfork add-demo-feature` -> copy link
  - explain PR template
  - explain target branch
  - explain "Allow edits by maintainers"
  - cancel
  - my fork -> branches -> delete

- (7) Check out someone else's work
  - have a look at an existing PR, look at all tabs, show suggestion feature
  - but sometimes we want to really build and try sth out ...
  - `git remote -v`
  - `git remote add alex git@github.com:ajaust/precice.git` if I don't have remote already (or somebody else)
  - `git fetch alex`
  - `git checkout -t alex/[branch-name]`
  - I could now also push to `ajaust`'s remote

## Clicker quiz about Git

| Duration | Format | Material |

| 30 minutes | quiz | [`git_quiz.md`](https://github.com/Simulation-Software-Engineering/Lecture-Material/blob/main/version-control/material/git_quiz.md) |

## My favorite neat little Git trick

| Duration | Format |
| --- | --- |
| 30-45 minutes | student presentations and discussion |

- Students present in 3-5 mins their favorite *neat little Git trick* (a tool, a command, a configuration, a GitHub thing, ...).
- Preparation should not take longer than 15 mins, should be a demo.
- Lecturers also prepare some.
- Examples Benjamin:
  - `git blame` on GitHub
  - `git reflog`
  - [gitignore templates](https://github.com/github/gitignore)
  - [GitExplorer](https://gitexplorer.com/)
  - Shortcut `t` to search project files on GitHub
- More examples:
  - GitHub CLI
  - [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/)
- Collect links via PRs
  - `git effort` (from `git-extras`repository): Show effort statistics on file(s) in repository
  - `git commit -m "Title of commit" -d "Description of commit` to specify a commit message and description without going to vim
  - Use [aheadfork](https://github.com/mbomb007/aheadfork) to find GitHub forks that are ahead
  - Use [permanent links](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/creating-a-permanent-link-to-a-code-snippet#linking-to-code) on GitHub to refer to and display code snippets in issues
  - Coding in the cloud with GitHub [Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) and VS Code: type `.` in a repository to jump into the editor

Remarks:

- Only use a GUI once you understand command-line Git.
