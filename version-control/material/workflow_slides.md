# Working in Teams / Git Workflows

---

## Why Workflows?

- Git offers a lot of flexibility in managing changes
- When working in a team, some agreements need to be made however (especially on how to work with branches)

---

## Which Workflow?

- There are standard solutions
- It depends on the size of the team
- Workflow should enhance effectiveness of team, not be a burden that limits productivity

---

## Centralized Workflow

- Only one branch: the `main` branch
- Keep your changes in local commits till some feature is ready
- If ready, directly push to `main`; no PRs, no reviews
- Conflicts: fix locally (push not allowed anyway), use `git pull --rebase`
- **Good for**: small teams, small projects, projects that are anyway reviewed over and over again
- Example: LaTeX papers
  - Put each section in separate file
  - Put each sentence in separate line

---

## Feature Branch Workflow

- Each feature (or bugfix) in separate branch
- Push feature branch to remote, use descriptive name
  - e.g. issue number in name if each branch closes one issue
- `main` should never contain broken code
- Protect direct push to `main`
- PR (or MR) with review to merge from feature branch to `main`
- Rebase feature branch on `main` if necessary
- Delete remote branch once merged and no longer needed (one click on GitHub after merge)
- **Good for**: small teams, small projects, prototyping, websites (continuous deployment), documentation
- Aka [trunk-based development](https://www.atlassian.com/continuous-delivery/continuous-integration/trunk-based-development) or [GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/)

## Gitflow

- [Visualization by Vincent Driessen](https://nvie.com/img/git-model@2x.png), from [original blog post in 2010](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/)
- `main` and `develop`
  - `main` contains releases as tags
  - `develop` contains latest features
- Feature branches created of `develop`, PRs back to `develop`
- Protect `main` and (possibly) `develop` from direct pushes
- Dedicated release branches (e.g., `v1.0`) created of `develop`
  - Tested, fixed, merged to `main`
  - Afterwards, tagged, merged back to `develop`
- Hotfix branches directly of and to `main`
- **Good for**: software with users, larger teams
- There is a tool `git-flow`, a wrapper around `git`, e.g. `git flow init` ... but not really necessary IMHO

---

## Forking Workflow

- Gitflow + feature branches on other forks
- More control over access rights, distinguish between maintainers and external contributors
- Should maintainers also use branches on their forks?
  - Makes overview of branches easier
  - Distinguish between prototype branches (on fork, no PR), serious enhancements (on fork with PR), joint enhancements (on upstream)
- **Good for**: open-source projects with external contributions (used more or less in preCICE)

---

## Do Small PRs

- For all workflows, it is better to do small PRs
  - Easier to review
  - Faster to merge --> fewer conflicts
  - Easier to squash
