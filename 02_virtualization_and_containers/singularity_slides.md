## Introduction

- Initiated at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory
- Now: Developed by [Sylabs](https://sylabs.io)
- Written in    Go
- Comes in [different flavors](https://sylabs.io/singularity/)
    - SingularityCE (Community edition, open source, BSD licensed)
    - SingularityPro (Enterprise)
    - Singularity Enterprise (More enterprise?)
    - SingularityDesktop (Mac, Beta)
    - [Sylabs Cloud](https://cloud.sylabs.io/library)
        - Image registry and remote builder
    - [Singularity Hub](https://singularityhub.github.io)
        - Open source registry

---

## Goals

- Verifiable reproducibility and security
    - Immutable images with encryption and verification support
- Integration over isolation by default
    - Access hardware (GPU, network...) and filesystems
- Simple and effective security model
    - Same user inside and outside container
- "Mobility of Compute"
    - Single file container for easy transport and sharing

---

## Notable Properties / Differences Compared to Docker

- Only needs root when creating images
- User rights for running container
- Automatically mounts [common directories](https://sylabs.io/guides/latest/user-guide/bind_paths_and_mounts.html#system-defined-bind-paths)
    - `${HOME}`, `${PWD}`, network etc.
- Allows to run "untrusted user to run untrusted containers"
    - Important for shared facilities (computing centers etc.)
- (Normally) Immutable containers
    - Set up environment and immutable data in container
- Support for typical HPC environments (schedulers, MPI, GPU...)

---

## Typical Singularity Applications

- Bring Your Own Environment
- Reproducible research
- Software needs specific environment
    - Legacy code, commercial software, unmaintained research software
- "Hiding" complicated software stack
- Conservation of (complicated) workflows

---

## Useful Commands

- `singularity exec`
    - Execute a command within container
- `singularity run`
    - Launch a runscript within container
- `singularity shell`
    - Run a Bourne shell within container
- `singularity build`
    - Build a new Singularity container
    - Use `--sandbox` for mutable container
- `singularity pull`
    - Pull a Singularity/Docker container to ${PWD}

---

## Demo: Run prebuilt containers

Details available in [`overview.md`](https://github.com/Simulation-Software-Engineering/Lecture-Material/blob/main/virtualization-and-containers/overview.md)

---

## Defining and Building own Images

- Build instructions in text file
    - Git friendly
- Start from base images
    - Several bootstrap strategies (container sources)
    - Images can be based on Docker images
- Extra steps
    - `%post`: Steps after OS installation
    - `%environment`: Set environment variables (`PATH` etc.)
    - `%runscript`: Container behavior under `singularity run`
    - `%labels`: Extra information
    - `%pre`, `%setup`... (see [Documentation](https://sylabs.io/guides/master/user-guide/definition_files.html#sections))

---

## Image Recipe Example

```Singularity
BootStrap: library
From: ubuntu:18.04

%post
        apt-get -y update
        apt-get -y install date cowsay lolcat

%environment
        export LC_ALL=C
        export PATH=/usr/games:$PATH

%runscript
        date | cowsay | lolcat

%labels
        Author Sylabs
```

## Demo: Build own containers

Details available in [`overview.md`](https://github.com/Simulation-Software-Engineering/Lecture-Material/blob/main/virtualization-and-containers/overview.md)

---

## Advanced topics

- Run container as service (called `instance`)
- Parallel computing
    - Using correct MPI, network drivers
    - MPI: hybrid model, bind model
- Mounting additional directories
- Signing, sharing and sandbox containers
- Performance vs. Portability
    - Compile content with `arch=generic` or `arch=TARGET`?

---

## Summary

- Special container format for scientific computing
- Immutable containers in a single file
- Prefers integration over isolation
- Potential successor: [Sarus](https://user.cscs.ch/tools/containers/sarus/)
