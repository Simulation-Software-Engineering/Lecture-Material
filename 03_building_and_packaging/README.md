# Building and Packaging

Learning goals:

- What is code packaging and which technologies are available to package code
- How is Python code packaged for uploading to PyPI and installation with pip
- What are libraries, how can they be used
- How can codes be build and dependencies handled with Make and CMake
- How are software packages provided via common packaging approaches (pip, apt, npm)
- How are software packages provided for high-performance computing (Spack, EasyBuild)
