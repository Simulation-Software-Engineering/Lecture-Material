## Introduction

- Remember:

    > If you can't git diff a file format, it's broken.

- Infrastructure as code

    > Vagrant is a tool for building and managing virtual machine environments in a single workflow.

    [https://www.vagrantup.com/intro](https://www.vagrantup.com/intro)
- Initial release 2010 by Mitchell Hashimoto, now [HashiCorp](https://www.hashicorp.com/)
- HashiCorp develops open-source DevOps/Cloud tools like [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/), [TerraForm](https://www.terraform.io/)...

---

## Building Blocks

- Provisioners
    - Tool for configuring the boxes (install software on machine)
    - Examples: shell scripts, Chef, Puppet..
- Providers
    - "Backend" the box is based on
    - Examples: VirtualBox, Hyper-V, AWS, Docker...

---

## What for?

- Developing software
    - Set up consistent development environment
    - Share environment with others
- Testing software, workflows...
    - Disposable environments
    - Consistent workflows
- More general
    - Simple way to setup virtual machine
- Reproducible environment

---

## Advantages

- Strong focus on workflow consistency
- (Re)use existing images
- Automatize VM creation and configuration
    - Easier than with VirtualBox CLI and shell scripts
- Store in Git-friendly format
- For us:
    - Management of VirtualBox VMs (testing, developing...)
    - Sharing of VMs (debugging, workshops...)

---

## Some Useful Commands 1/2

- `vagrant init USERNAME/BOXNAME or URL`
    - Initializes repository in current directory
    - Creates `Vagrantfile` -> Text file (Git friendly)
- `vagrant up`
    - Create VM and start it
    - VM is stored in `${HOME}/.vagrant.d/boxes` (overruled by `VAGRANT_HOME`)
- `vagrant ssh`
    - Connect to VM via ssh
- `vagrant destroy`
    - Stops the virtual machine and removes its disk

---

## Some Useful Commands 2/2

- `vagrant box list`
    - Show available boxes
- `vagrant box remove NAMEOFBOX`
    - Remove a box completely
- `vagrant suspend`
    - Suspends machine (sleep)
- `vagrant halt`
    - Shuts down machine keeping changes
- `vagrant reload --provision` or `vagrant provision`
    - Rebuild (partially) build image

---

## Demo: Premade Vagrant VM

Details available in [`overview.md`](https://github.com/Simulation-Software-Engineering/Lecture-Material/blob/main/virtualization-and-containers/overview.md)

---

## Structure of Vagrant Box

- File `Vagrantfile`
    - Contains configuration of VM
    - Ruby script
- Supplementary files, scripts etc. for configuring VM
    - Example: `bootstrap.sh`
- Files are usually text files (Git friendly)

---

## Setting up a Virtual Machine

- Install VirtualBox
- Install Vagrant (ideally from homepage so it is a recent release)
- Create `Vagrantfile` and specify image

    ```ruby
    Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
        config.vm.box = "ajaust/sse-first-steps"
        config.vm.box_version = "0.1.0"
    end
    ```

- Alternative:

    ```
    vagrant init ajaust/sse-first-steps
    ```

- Start VM with `vagrant up`

---

## Exchanging Files

- Vagrant mounts shared folders
    - Check output when VM starts

    ```bash
    default: Mounting shared folders...
    ```

    - Files can be exchanged between Guest and Host (bidirectional)
- Default:
    - Directory containing `Vagrantfile` mounted to `/vagrant` in Guest

---

## Vagrant Cloud

- Repository of premade boxes: [https://app.vagrantup.com/](https://app.vagrantup.com/)
- Pack box:

    ```bash
    vagrant package --base "NAMEOFVM" --output BOXNAME.box
    ```

    - `NAMEOFVM` is name as shown in VirtualBox
    - `BOXNAME` name to store box to
- [Publish own boxes](https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/providers/virtualbox/boxes) by uploading to [Vagrant Cloud](https://app.vagrantup.com/)

---

## Demo: Own box

- [Own box online](https://app.vagrantup.com/ajaust/boxes/sse-first-steps/versions/0.1.0)

Details available in [`overview.md`](https://github.com/Simulation-Software-Engineering/Lecture-Material/blob/main/virtualization-and-containers/overview.md)

---

## Demo: preCICE VM

- [https://github.com/precice/vm](https://github.com/precice/vm)
- [Premade box](https://app.vagrantup.com/precice/boxes/precice-vm)

Details available in [`overview.md`](https://github.com/Simulation-Software-Engineering/Lecture-Material/blob/main/virtualization-and-containers/overview.md)

---

## Summary

- Open-source tool
- Git-friendly way of configuring VMs
- Simple management of VMs
- Creates consistent workflows
- Flexible due to big variety of provisioners and providers
- Premade images can be used and shared
