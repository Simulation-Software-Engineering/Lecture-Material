## Brief idea of this exercise

In this exercise you will convert a raw Python code into a properly packaged code which is uploaded to a package manager. There are many such examples out there but doing the whole workflow yourself once is important to get the hang of the process. Our intention is not to provide a brand new exercise but to take the concepts of packaging and package management and put them into context of simulation software engineering.

1. One group member forks the [raw code repository](TODO)
2. Read the [README](TODO) of the repository and understand the main steps of converting a raw code to a packaged code. Also refer to the steps in the [example from python.org](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/packaging-projects/#packaging-python-projects) as these are the steps which will be followed
3. Restructure the code into the specified file format and prepare the repository for packaging.
4. ... TODO: Some detailed steps of packaging
