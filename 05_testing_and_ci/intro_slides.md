## What is testing?

- Smelling old milk before using it!
- A way to determine if a software is producing reliable results
- Manual testing vs. Automated testing

---

## Why should you test your software?

- Improve software reliability and reproducibility
- Almost all software is better off being tested regularly
- Ensure that a distributed version of a software actually works

---

## Ways to test software

- Assertions
- Unit testing
- Integration testing
- Regression testing

---

## Assertions

- Principle of *defensive programming*
- Python does nothing when an assertion is true; returns error when false
- Types of assertion statements:
    - Precondition
    - Postcondition
    - Invariant
- A basic but powerful tool to test a software on-the-go
