# Building and Packaging

Learning goals:

- Explain why software is packaged.
- Create Python packages, publish on PyPI, and install with pip.
- Understand the difference between static and dynamic libraries and common ways of installation on Linux.
- Build C++ software and handle dependencies with Make and CMake.
- Package C++ software with CPack and create Debian packages.
- Create Spack packages, e.g., for high-performance computing systems with restricted access rights.
