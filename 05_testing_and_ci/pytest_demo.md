# Notes for pytest Demo

Example code is in [05_testing_and_ci/examples](https://github.com/Simulation-Software-Engineering/Lecture-Material/blob/main/05_testing_and_ci/examples)

## pytest

- **Note**: `main()` function in `operations.py` has assertion statements to check if the correct data type is passed to specific functions.
- Assertion statements are the most basic way of testing code and are also used in unit and integration testing.
