# Exercise: Packaging Python code Part 1

Starting remarks:

- Create a branch of the exercise repository and complete all the tasks on the branch
- To submit the assignment open a pull request from your branch to the main branch
- Every student is expected to contribute in the exercise session
- Figure out a way for all group members to work on the same fork, for example, by using branches

Lets convert a raw Python code into a properly packaged code which is uploaded to a package manager. There are many such examples out there but doing the whole workflow yourself once is important to get the hang of the process. Our intention is not to provide a brand new exercise but to take the concepts of packaging and package management and put them into context of simulation software engineering. Every group is expected to have an uploaded version of the packaged code at the end of the exercise.

1. One group member forks the [raw code repository](TODO)
2. Read the [README](TODO) of the repository and understand the main steps of converting a raw code to a packaged code. Also refer to the steps in the [example from python.org](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/packaging-projects/#packaging-python-projects) as these are the steps which will be followed
3. Restructure the code into the specified file format and prepare the repository for packaging.
4. ... TODO: Some detailed steps of packaging
