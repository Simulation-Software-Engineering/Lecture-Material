# Workflow Automation

---

## Learning Goals

- Name and explain common workflows to automate in RSE.
- Explain the differences between the various continuous methodologies.
- Explain why automation is crucial in RSE.
- Write basic automation scripts for GitHub Actions.
- Read basic automation scripts for GitLab CI/CD.
- Name and roughly explain the necessary steps to host GitLab Runners yourself.

---

## Why Automation?

- Automatize tasks
    - Run tests frequently, give feedback early etc.
    - Ensure reproducible test environments
    - Cannot forget automatized tasks
    - Less burden to developer (and their workstation)
    - Avoid manual errors
- Process often integrated in development workflow
    - Example: Support by Git hooks or Git forges

---

## Typical Automation Tasks in RSE

- Check code formatting and quality
- Compile and test code for different platforms
- Generate coverage reports and visualization
- Build documentation and deploy it
- Build, package, and upload releases

---

## Continuous Methodologies (1/2)

- **Continuous Integration** (CI)
    - Continuously integrate changes into "main" branch
    - Avoids "merge hell"
    - Relies on testing and checking code continuously
        - Should be automatized

---

## Continuous Methodologies (2/2)

- **Continuous Delivery** (CD)
    - Software is in a state that allows new release at any time
    - Software package is built
    - Actual release triggered manually
- **Continuous Deployment** (CD)
    - Software is in a state that allows new release at any time
    - Software package is built
    - Actual release triggered automatically (continuously)
