# Virtualization and Containers

Learning goals:

- What is the difference between virtualization and containers?
- When to use virtual machines and when containers.
- How to work with virtual machines (VirtualBox) and how to manage these with Vagrant.
- Building containers with Docker and Singularity.
- Understand pros and cons of different container technologies.
- Student can set up their own containers tailored to their requirements.
