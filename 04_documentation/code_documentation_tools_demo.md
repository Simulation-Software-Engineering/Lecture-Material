# Code Documentation Tools Demo

## Docstrings

Goal: Add docstrings to the Python Code

### Steps

0. Initial state is in tag TODO
1. Explain Python code shortly. Emphasize that we have a class now so we show how to document a class.
2. Add docstrings to class, and solve function.
    - TODO: Document functions is separate Python file and/or move them back into the main file.

## Sphinx

We follow the [quickstart guide](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/quickstart.html) and the [tutorial](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/tutorial/index.html) of Sphinx here.

- If not already installed, we install Sphinx via pip

  ```
  pip install -U Sphinx
  ```

- We start from scratch. We create the

  ```bash
  sphinx-quickstart
  ```
