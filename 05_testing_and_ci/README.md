# Testing and CI

Learning goals:

- Justify the effort of developing testing infrastructure for simulation software.
- Discern the concepts of unit testing, integration testing and regression testing with the perspective of simulation software.
- Work with the Python testing frameworks `pytest` and `unittest`.
- Name and explain common workflows to automate in RSE.
- Explain the differences between the various continuous methodologies.
- Explain why automation is crucial in RSE.
- Write basic automation scripts for GitHub Actions.
- Read basic automation scripts for GitLab CI/CD.
- Name and roughly explain the necessary steps to host GitLab Runners yourself.
- Write simple tests for C++ toy codes with `Boost.Test`.
- Know about general concepts of test frameworks such as fixtures and decorators.
- Use CTest to call tests from CMake.
- Know about common challenges of unit and integration tests in real simulation software through preCICE as an example.
- Explain how `Boost.Test`, CMake, and GitHub Actions can work together.
