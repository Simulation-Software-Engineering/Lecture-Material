## Git Cheat Sheet

- Observations:
    - Pay more attention to descriptions of issues and PRs: what, why, how, ...
    - As reviewer, don't just accept, but think about how to increase quality
    - You don't seem to like perfect linear histories :grin: ... in many cases just use `rebase & merge` or `squash & merge` button on GitHub
- **Deadline**: next Monday, Nov 8, 9am

## Challenge

- Have you seen **matching** on [GitLab](https://gitlab-sim.informatik.uni-stuttgart.de/simulation-software-engineering/challenge/-/issues/1)?
- Information on **first presentations** also on [GitLab](https://gitlab-sim.informatik.uni-stuttgart.de/simulation-software-engineering/challenge/-/issues/2)
    - Half of students present first step, the other half second step (everybody third step)
    - Still, everybody needs to hand in a report each time
    - Please let us know (as early as possible) if you drop out such that we can find another presenter
