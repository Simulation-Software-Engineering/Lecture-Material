# Packaging for High-Performance Computing and for you

---

## Learning goals

- What are the challenges when bringing (your) software to supercomputers?
- How to use Spack to install software.
- How to create a Spack package for your own software.

---

## Introduction 1/2

- Scientific software installation on supercomputers faces challenges:
    - Parallel architectures (MPI, OpenMP, HPX...)
    - Special hardware (accelerators, network...)
    - Greatly varying architectures (AMD, Intel, ARM...)
    - Missing dependencies (too new, too old...)
    - Admins will not/cannot install software for you, you do not have superuser rights

---

## Introduction 2/2

- Software should have best possible performance
    - Software needs to be **compiled** to get best performance (special libraries, compilers...)
    - Optimized compilation settings (best settings not always obvious)
    - Optimal settings depend on platform (supercomputers might be heterogenous, different generation of CPUs e.g.)
- **HPC-friendly package managers** can help with
    - organizing software installations
    - compilation of software

## Spack Introduction

- HPC-friendly package manager
    - Common scientific software included
    - No superuser rights needed
    - Spack's [dependencies](https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html#system-prerequisites) commonly available on Supercomputers
        - Python, git, curl...
- Deals with dependency resolution, compilation flags and **compilation**
- [Open-source project on GitHub](https://github.com/spack/spack)
- Valuable resources:
    - [Good starter guides](https://spack-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
    - [Extensive documentation](https://spack.readthedocs.io)
    - [Spack Slack](https://slack.spack.io/) for communication with community
- Heavily relies on concretizer [`clingo`](https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html#bootstrapping-clingo)
    - Prefers to install newest version of packages

## Step by Step Plan

- **Goal**: Create a Spack package for HelloWorld code
- Steps:
    1. Install and configure Spack
    2. Learn how to use Spack for package management and installation
    3. Create a Spack package for our HelloWorld code
    4. Install HelloWorld code using our new package
- Code is on [GitHub](https://github.com/Simulation-Software-Engineering/HelloWorld)

---

## Spack Installation

- Git repository of Python scripts

  ```bash
  git clone -b releases/v0.17 https://github.com/spack/spack.git
  ```

    - `v0.17` is currently the latest release
    - Update to newer versions using `git pull`/`git checkout -b`

- Set up Spack

  ```bash
  . <spack_prefix>/share/spack/setup-env.sh
  ```

    - Add this command to `.bashrc` to make permanent
    - `SPACK_ROOT` points to local Spack directory

- Find basic compilers and packages

  ```bash
  spack compiler find
  spack external find
  ```

  `spack external find` might fail (experimental feature)

---

## Spack Configuration and Caches

- Spack heavily relies on `yaml` files
    - Take care of spaces when editing
- User configuration in `${HOME}/.spack`
- Several [other configuration scopes](https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configuration.html)
- If cache is out of date check `${HOME}/.spack/cache/`

---

## General Spack Usage

- Spack works with `spec`s (`spec`=specification)

  ```
  spack install petsc@3.16.1+mpi -shared~suite-sparse
  ```

  A spec may be more precise than just a package name.

- Loading and unloading of specs

  ```bash
  spack load petsc@3.16.1
  spack unload petsc@3.16.1
  ```

- [General syntax](https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/command_index.html)

  ```bash
  spack COMMAND OPTION
  ```

---

## Common Spack Commands 1/2

- `spack find`:
    - Show packages in root environment
- `spack spec SPEC`:
    - Show packages that would be installed for specified package
- `spack install SPEC`:
    - Installs package
    - `--reuse` parameter will try to reuse installed packages
- `spack uninstall SPEC`:
    - Uninstalls package
- `spack load SPEC`:
    - Loads package into current environment
- `spack unload SPEC`:
    - Removes package from current environment

---

## Common Spack Commands 2/2

- `spack info PKG`:
    - Shows information about given package
- `spack remove SPEC`:
    - Removes a spec from current environment
- `spack gc`:
    - Garbage collection, removes all packages not needed in any environment
    - Will remove compile-time/link-time dependencies

---

## Spack Environments

- Spack organizes packages in [environments](https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/environments.html)
- `spack find` shows packages in current environment
- By default one is in the "root" environment
    - The "root" environment contains all packages installed/known by Spack
- Environment has its own `view`
    - Only sees specs added to this environment
- Environments can be named for easier identification

---

## Common Spack Environments Commands

- `spack env list`:
    - List available environments
- `spack env create ENV`:
    - Create new environment with name `ENV`
- `spack env activate -p ENV`:
    - Activate environment `ENV` and prepend name to terminal
- `spack env deactivate`:
    - Deactivate a terminal (alternative: `despacktivate`)
- `spack env remove -p ENV`:
    - Remove environment `ENV`
- `spack add SPEC`:
    - Add `SPEC` to environment without installing
- `spack concretize`:
    - Concretize the specs of active environment

---

## Spack Demo 1

- Set up Spack
- Inspect environments
- Install a simple spec

---

## Spack Packaging

- By default packages reside in

  ```bash
  ${SPACK_ROOT}/var/spack/repos/builtin/packages/PACKAGENAME/
  ````

- `package.py` inside `PACKAGENAME/` describes installation routine
- Installation recipes are Python code
    - You can write own logic/helper functions in your recipe
- `spack create URL`
    - Creates boilerplate package from template
    - `URL` points to some archive one can download
- `spack edit PKG`:
    - Open given Spack package in editor
    - Set `EDITOR` environment variable to control what editor is used

---

## Common Spack Package Properties 1/2


- Package class definition

  ```python
  class Packagename(CMakePackage)
  ```

- Download URL of package

  ```python
  """Description"""
  ```

- Download URL of package

  ```python
  url = "https://...archive/refs/tags/v0.3.0.tar.gz"
  ```

- Version number and hash of archive

  ```python
  version('0.2.0', 'sha256=a77499bbfd0b8f4d7070b06c491e062fa608fdd7e939d6c37796bdafdbbaa35a')
  ```

- Variants user may choose

  ```python
  variant('name', default=BOOL, decription="STRING")
  ```

  Example:

  ```python
  variant('python', default=True, description='Enable Python support')
  ```

---

## Common Spack Package Properties 2/2

- Dependency specification

  ```python
  depends_on('PACKAGE@VERSION', when='CONDITION')
  ```

  Example:

  ```python
  variant('python', default=True, description='Enable Python support')

  depends_on('python@3:', when='+python')
  depends_on('zlib@:1.2', when='@0.2:')
  ```

- `@3:`, `@:3`, `@2:3`:
    - Minimum, maximum version and version range
    - Version numbers are **inclusive**
    - `@2:3`: Any version starting with `2` or `3`
    - May use semantic versioning, e.g., `@2.3.1:2.4`

---

## Spack Demo 2

- Create package for our [HelloWorld example](https://github.com/Simulation-Software-Engineering/HelloWorld)
    1. Create boilerplate package
    2. Add package details
    3. Verify package
    4. Model dependencies and add variants
