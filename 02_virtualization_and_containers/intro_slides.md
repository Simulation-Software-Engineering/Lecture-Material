# Virtualization and Containers

---

## Learning Goals

- What is the difference between virtualization and containers?
- When and how to use virtual machines and/or containers.
- How to work with virtual machines (VirtualBox) and how to manage these with Vagrant.
- How to work with containers with Docker (and Singularity).
- You know how to set up own containers tailored to your requirements.

## Virtualization and Containers for SSE

- Developing, testing and debugging software
    - Abstraction layer for different OS, configurations etc.
    - Ensure software quality
- Moving/Sharing software
    - Avoid compilation and/or setup complexity, OS dependency
    - Work around target limitations (e.g. HPC)
- Manage complex workflows
    - Ideally under version control
    - (Potentially) Break down big software into smaller
- Reproducible research
    - Make sure others get the same results
    - Make sure others are able to run your software (also in future)
- Focus on established, open-source software
