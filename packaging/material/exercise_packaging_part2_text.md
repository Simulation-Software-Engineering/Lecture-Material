# Exercise: Packaging Python code Part 2

## Brief idea of this exercise

In Part 1 we converted a raw code into a project that can be packaged and published on a package index. In this part of the exercise we will actually publish our project on the package index TestPyPI

## Step 6 - Create an account on TestPyPI

- Create an account on TestPyPI

## Step 7 - Create an API Token on TestPyPI

- Create an API Token on TestPyPI
- **Note down the name and token value because this is the username and password for publishing**

## Step 8 - Uploading the package

- Install Twine on your system
- Upload the distribution archives using the commands shown in the lecture notes
- Go to TestPyPI and view the package which has been uploaded
- Take a screenshot of the TestPyPI webpage which displays your package. This screenshot will be used for submission

## Step 9 - Testing the deployed package

- Using the commands from the lecture notes try to install the package using `pip` and also run the code by importing the `solve()` functionality in a Python script or an interactive Python shell

## Step 10 - Submitting the exercise

- Open a pull request from your branch to the `main` branch of the exercise repository
- Add the TestPyPI screenshot in the description of the pull request
