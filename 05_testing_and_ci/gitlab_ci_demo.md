# Demo: GitLab Runner and GitLab CI/CD

## 1. GitLab Runner

### 1. GitLab Runner Installation

- "Easy" via Docker

  ```bash
  docker run -d --name gitlab-runner --restart always \
           -v /srv/gitlab-runner/config:/etc/gitlab-runner \
           -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
           gitlab/gitlab-runner:latest
  ```

- Stores configuration on you local machine

  ```bash
   /srv/gitlab-runner/config:/etc/gitlab-runner/config.toml
   ```

- See also [installation instructions](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/install/)
- And more specific [Run GitLab Runner in a container](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/install/docker.html)

### 2. Runner registration

Information needed:

- Go to fresh [automation lecture repository](https://gitlab-sim.informatik.uni-stuttgart.de/simulation-software-engineering/automation-lecture) on our GitLab instance.
- Show that there are currently pipelines with the label "stuck". I have added the repository which contains a valid GitLab CI/CD configuration while there are/were no runners assigned.
- GitLab instance URL. In our case <https://gitlab-sim.informatik.uni-stuttgart.de>
- There exist different executors
    - We use `docker` executor. This makes it obligatory to specify a default image which can be overwritten in the configuration file of the pipeline.
- Find **registration token of repository**

  ```text
  GitLab repository -> Settings -> CI/CD -> Runners ->  Specific runners
  ```

    - Registration process in detail (terminal output)

        ```text
        docker run --rm -it -v /srv/gitlab-runner/config:/etc/gitlab-runner gitlab/gitlab-runner register
        Runtime platform                                    arch=amd64 os=linux pid=7 revision=5316d4ac version=14.6.0
        Running in system-mode.

        Enter the GitLab instance URL (for example, https://gitlab.com/):
        URL, e.g. https://gitlab-sim.informatik.uni-stuttgart.de
        Enter the registration token:
        TOKEN
        Enter a description for the runner:
        [37d9963c0f15]: Lecture test runner
        Enter tags for the runner (comma-separated):

        Registering runner... succeeded                     runner=sCr8x1WF
        Enter an executor: kubernetes, custom, docker-ssh, virtualbox, docker+machine, docker-ssh+machine, docker, parallels, shell, ssh:
        docker
        Enter the default Docker image (for example, ruby:2.6):
        alpine:latest
        Runner registered successfully. Feel free to start it, but if it's running already the config should be automatically reloaded!
        ```

- Afterwards, verify under `GitLab repository -> Settings -> CI/CD -> Runners ->  Specific runners` that a runner with the specified name shows up.
- Checkout the runner configuration in `/srv/gitlab-runner/config/config.toml` on the host.

  ```bash
  sudo vim /srv/gitlab-runner/config/config.toml
  ```

  should look like

  ```toml
  concurrent = 1
  check_interval = 0

  [session_server]
    session_timeout = 1800

  [[runners]]
    name = "Lecture test runner"
    url = "https://gitlab-sim.informatik.uni-stuttgart.de"
    token = "TOKEN"
    executor = "docker"
    [runners.custom_build_dir]
    [runners.cache]
      [runners.cache.s3]
      [runners.cache.gcs]
      [runners.cache.azure]
    [runners.docker]
      tls_verify = false
      image = "alpine:latest"
      privileged = false
      disable_entrypoint_overwrite = false
      oom_kill_disable = false
      disable_cache = false
      volumes = ["/cache"]
      shm_size = 0
  ```

- More information can be found in the GitLab documentation in section [Registering runners](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/register/index.html#docker).

## 2. Setting up GitLab CI/CD

- Create/show templates
    - Go to "Repository" -> "+ sign" to add a new file -> New file -> "Select a template type" -> `.gitlab-ci.yml` -> Choose some template. Abort then because we do not want to use any of these templates.
- Checkout tag `gitlab-ci-added` or `main` branch of [repository](https://github.com/Simulation-Software-Engineering/automation-lecture)
- Show our `.gitlab-ci.yml`

  ```yaml
  stages:
  - check
  - build
  - test

  image: ajaust/automation-lecture

  check_code:
    stage: check
    script:
      - echo "This job builds something quickly."
      - black --check .

  build_code:
    stage: build
    variables:
      PROJECT_NAME: "Automation Lecture"
    script:
      - echo "Building project $PROJECT_NAME"

  test_code:
    stage: test
    script:
      - python -m unittest
  ```

- Trigger the pipeline via commit or re-trigger it in GitLab's overview.
- Show different stages and their output.
- Show file in CI/CD editor.
    - GitLab repository -> CI/CD -> Editor
- The students probably know the emails one gets for broken and fixed pipelines.

## 3. CI with explicit dependencies

- On can also explicitly declare dependencies between jobs using the `needs` keyword:

  ```yaml
  stages:
    - check
    - build
    - test

  image: ajaust/automation-lecture

  check_code:
    stage: check
    script:
      - echo "This job builds something quickly."
      - black --check .

  build_code:
    stage: build
    needs: [check_code]
    variables:
      PROJECT_NAME: "Automation Lecture"
    script:
      - echo "Building project $PROJECT_NAME"

  test_code:
    stage: test
    needs: [build_code]
    script:
      - python -m unittest
  ```

- Having dependencies declared allows GitLab to build a graph (DAG) which could allow for more efficient job scheduling.
    - Show this in the pipeline overview. (CI/CD -> Pipelines -> Choose most recent pipeline run)

## 4. Other Workflows/Pipelines
