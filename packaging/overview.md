# Code Packaging

Learning goals:

- Understanding the necessity to somehow package code written in a crude way
- Being able to determine the type of packaging required for the code
- Modifying code and packaging it according to a standardization
- Uploading code to a remote package managing platform and testing the installation

## Survey

| Duration | Format | Material |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 15 minutes | poll | [packaging_survey.md](https://github.com/Simulation-Software-Engineering/Lecture-Material) |

- Conduct an online poll with four questions to get an impression of how much the students already know about packaging
- Discuss results and quantify the minimum knowledge level of the class
- **Most important question**: How do students perceive the term *packaging*?
