# Documentation

Learning Goals

- Raise **awareness** that documentation is crucial in RSE.
- Understand that there is a difference between documentation and **good documentation**.
- Get to know the purpose and basic structure of several **standard documentation building blocks** (README, commit message, changelog, ...).
- **Not**: Learn how to really write good documentation. This takes practice and much more than 90 minutes.
- **Not**: Any technical tools. This will come next week.
