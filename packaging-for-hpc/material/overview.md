# Debian packages and packaging for HPC

*Learning goals*

- How to automatize compilation of codes.
- How to easily add your code to package managers for
    - reproducibility
    - easier user compilation
- Reproducible builds/environments?

## Quiz (optional)

- Did you ever create your own Debian package?
- How do you install software on a server/cluster?

## General package creation / Debian packages

| Duration | Format |
| --- | --- |
| 20 minutes | Slides |

- `deb` packages are common in the Linux world
    - Used by Debian its derivatives (such as Ubuntu)
- **TODO** Figure out how to build Debian packages
- Can be used to package packages of all kind

- Challenge:
    1. Software should be easy to install
    2. I want high performance on a super computer -> Compile software with platform dependent optimization (`-march=native`). Might have vendor-specific libraries (MPI, BLAS etc.) that are crucial for performance.
    3. Users do not have root rights.
- This is a current topic of great interest: [European Environment for Scientific Software Installations (EESSI)](https://github.com/EESSI/)
- Common in HPC environments:
    - EasyBuild
    - Spack
- Both tools heavily rely on Python and are using `archspec`.
- Idea: Describe installation procedure in a package in order to automatize it.
- Tool (try to) will do dependency resolution, compilation and installation.
- EasyBuild
    - Originated from Ghent University, Belgium
    - Will create special environment variables that are prefixed with `EB`
- Spack
    - Originated from LLNL in the US
    - Can also be used to roll-out precompiled binaries
- European Environment for Scientific Software Installations (EESSI) tries to simplify the installation routine by providing precompiled packages with optimizations enabled.

## Exercise

| Duration | Format |
| --- | --- |
| XX minutes | Exercise |

- Install Spack
- Set up spack environment using preinstalled packages `spack external find`
- Install some package via Spack
- Build a spack package for a C++ Code (CMake) and one for Python
    - **TODO** Can we base that on some result from an earlier lecture?
