# Boost.Test in the Real World: preCICE Demo

Look around preCICE in the terminal + text editor.

## First Look

- `cd src && ls`: preCICE is organized in several namespaces.
- `cd math && ls`: Each namespace has a `tests` folder
- Look at `math/tests/DifferenceTest.cpp`
    - Imports `testing/Testing.hpp`, there we handle UTF imports
    - Test suite for `math` namespace and test suite per file (here `math/differences.hpp`)
    - `BOOST_CHECK` actually not recommended to use. Is used internally by `BOOST_TEST`.
    - Powerful macro `PRECICE_TEST(1_rank)`; here it means that this test is run on one MPI rank
        - Tests are normally run on 4 MPI ranks to test parallel implementation and to mimic different coupled solvers

## Unit vs. Integration Tests

- Clear separation in preCICE: integration tests only directly use API of preCICE.
- They are located in `tests` folder.
- Look at `tests/serial/initialize-data/Explicit.cpp`
    - Explain `PRECICE_TEST` and how it is used

## White-Box Testing

- Not a UTF feature, but an independent C++ trick
- Explain black-box testing:
    - A class has a public API and we only use this API for testing.
    - Makes a lot of sense
- Sometimes, we want white-box testing:
    - Why? Access and/or check private members
    - Could `friend` the test, but this quickly gets out of hand
- Example: class `src/time/Waveform.hpp`
    - Has public and private members. We want to check the private members in tests.
    - Does not `friend` every test, but only `WaveformFixture`
    - `src/testing/WaveformFixture.hpp` has functions to access private members
    - This fixture is used in many tests in `src/time/tests/WaveformTests`

## Test Matrices

- Look at `tests/serial/mapping-nearest-projection/QuadMappingDiagonalNearestProjectionEdgesTallKite.cpp`:
    - Define test matrix with data sets: `boost::unit_test::data::make`

## Test Context

- Look at `src/mapping/tests/NearestProjectionMappingTest.cpp`:
    - `BOOST_TEST_CONTEXT` outputs context information on failure

## CMake

- Look at `cmake/CTestConfig.cmake`: More things tested than only UTF
