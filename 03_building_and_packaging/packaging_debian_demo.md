# Debian packages

## Learning goals

- How to add an install target to a CMake project.
- How to package a CMake project via `CPack`.
- How to create a Debian (`deb`) package of your program/library using CPack.
- How to check the resulting Debian package.

## 1. Preparing Project (Demo 1)

- We will extend the code from the previous lecture.
    - [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Simulation-Software-Engineering/HelloWorld)
- Make sure two files are created (a library and an executable). This should be the case when starting with the code from last week's lecture.
    - **Warning** We handle example as an seperate executable + library **for demonstration** only. There is normally no need handle internal dependencies that complicated.
- We add the following changes
    - Adding a version number to the project. This is not needed yet, but I am afraid of forgetting it later.
    - We mark the include files needed to use the `libsse` library, i.e., `sse/sse.hpp` as publicly visible. This is needed such that CMake knows which headers should be public and should be installed. By default CMake assumes headers are for interal use (within the current project) only.
        - The [documentation](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/prop_tgt/PUBLIC_HEADER.html) is a bit confusing as it hints that this should/could only be used with Apple framework projects.
    - We define the target's include directory, i.e., where do we have to look for the dependency depending on the type of build (internally, top-level cmake project, external dependency)
    - We want to make sure that we have an `install` target for make that, at the same time, considers typical installation directories. That means `make install` should binaries in a `<prefix>/bin`, libraries in `<prefix>/lib` or `<prefix>/lib/helloworld`, include files in `<prefix>/include` etc. We include the predefined CMake macro `GNUInstallDirs` to get predefined variables such as installation directories. The directories names and their purpose are defined in the [GNU coding standard](https://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/html_node/Directory-Variables.html).

Changes:

```diff
- project("HelloWorld")
+ project("HelloWorld" VERSION 0.1.0)
+ add_library(sse sse/sse.cpp)
+
+ set_target_properties(sse PROPERTIES PUBLIC_HEADER sse/sse.hpp)

+target_include_directories(sse
+    PRIVATE
+        # where the library itself will look for its internal headers
+        ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/helloworld
+    PUBLIC
+        # where top-level project will look for the library's public headers
+        $<BUILD_INTERFACE:${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/helloworld>
+        # where external projects will look for the library's public headers
+        $<INSTALL_INTERFACE:${CMAKE_INSTALL_INCLUDEDIR}/helloworld>
+)

+# Create install targets
+include(GNUInstallDirs)
+install(TARGETS helloworld sse
+  LIBRARY DESTINATION ${CMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR}
+  ARCHIVE DESTINATION ${CMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR}
+  RUNTIME DESTINATION ${CMAKE_INSTALL_BINDIR}
+  PUBLIC_HEADER DESTINATION ${CMAKE_INSTALL_INCLUDEDIR}/helloworld
+  INCLUDES DESTINATION ${CMAKE_INSTALL_INCLUDEDIR}/helloworld
+  )
```

- Fire up a prepared container for testing. Container is beneficial as it allows us to mess around with the container's paths without messing up our own system. From the example repository I run

  ```bash
  sudo docker run --rm -it --name ubuntu-packaging --mount type=bind,source="$(pwd)",target=/mnt/cpack-example jaustar/debian-package-building-base
  ```

- Build the library and install it

  ```bash
  mkdir build && cd build
  cmake -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
  make -j
  sudo make install
  ```

- Installs in `/usr/local` which is the defaul value of `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` when using CMake.

  ```bash
  -- Install configuration: "Release"
  -- Installing: /usr/local/bin/helloworld
  -- Installing: /usr/local/lib/libsse.so
  -- Installing: /usr/local/include/helloworld/sse.hpp
  ```

  **Note** that we have an empty configuration here if we do not specify a `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE`. Especially when distributing a package one should set a `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE`.
- Now we can run `helloworld` from anywhere on the system.
    - We might need to set `PATH="/usr/local/bin":"${PATH}"`. In my container it was not set.
- Tear down container

**Note**: At this point we have a package with reasonable installation routine. This is something we would need for (different) packaging solutions such as Debian packages and

## 2. Extend CMake configuration (Demo 1)

In this step we add a CPack configuration such that we can actually create a package.

- We will add the configuration in another directory. Create `cmake/Packaging.cmake`
    - This allows to separate different parts of the CMake configuration.
- Additions to `CMakeLists.txt`

  ```diff
  + # Packaging section
  + # Adding other cmake modules
  + set(CMAKE_MODULE_PATH "${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/cmake")
  + # Include our packaging module
  + include(Packaging)
  ```

- Edit `cmake/Packaging.cmake` and add some properties.
    - `CPack` should be included at the end so it can ingest all preset variables
    - We can set version, e.g., but by default it will ingest the version number from the `project()` statement in `CMakeLists.txt`.
    - Full list of statements in [documentation](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/CPack.html). Note, that the current statements are common properties of the packaging module.

  ```diff
  + set(CPACK_PACKAGE_NAME ${PROJECT_NAME})
  +
  + set(CPACK_PACKAGE_DESCRIPTION_SUMMARY "SSE hello world example project"
  +   CACHE STRING "Extended summary.")
  +
  + set(CPACK_PACKAGE_VENDOR "SSE Lecturers / Employer")
  +
  + set(CPACK_PACKAGE_CONTACT "firstname.lastname@example.com")
  + set(CPACK_PACKAGE_MAINTAINERS "SSE lecturers ${CPACK_PACKAGE_CONTACT}")
  +
  + set(CPACK_PACKAGE_HOMEPAGE_URL "https://simulation-software-engineering.github.io/homepage/")
  +
  + set(CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION_MAJOR ${PROJECT_VERSION_MAJOR})
  + set(CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION_MINOR ${PROJECT_VERSION_MINOR})
  + set(CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION_PATCH ${PROJECT_VERSION_PATCH})
  +
  + include(CPack)
  ```

- Start up container again and then prepare project

  ```bash
  mkdir build && cd build
  cmake -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
  ```

- This will create new files `CPackConfig.cmake` and `CPackSourceConfig.cmake`
- We can create a package, e.g., `tar.gz`

  ```bash
  cpack -G TGZ
  ```

  **NOTE** If this fails, this is due missing a `README.md` and `LICENSE` file. CPack expects these file to be present. They are important! Especially the license.

  `-G` is used to specify the package generator. We choose `TGZ` the generator for a compressed archive. We obtain the resulting file `HelloWorld-0.1.0-Linux.tar.gz`. The file name consists of the project name, version number and installation target.

- Inspect the package

  ```bash
  tar -xzf HelloWorld-0.1.0-Linux.tar.gz
  ```

  The unpacked package in directory `HelloWorld-0.1.0-Linux` has three subdirectories `bin/`, `lib/`, `include/`.

- We can also run `cpack -G DEB`, but it will complain

  ```bash
  $ cpack -G DEB
  CPack: Create package using DEB
  CPack: Install projects
  CPack: - Run preinstall target for: HelloWorld
  CPack: - Install project: HelloWorld []
  CPack: Create package
  -- CPACK_DEBIAN_PACKAGE_DEPENDS not set, the package will have no dependencies.
  CPack: - package: /mnt/cpack-example/build/HelloWorld-0.1.0-Linux.deb generated.
  ```

  The dependencies are missing for example.

## 3. Extend CPack configuration for Debian Package (Demo 2)

- Setting up Debian package generator by adding lines to `cmake/Packaging.cmake`:

  ```diff
  + # Debian packaging section
  + set(CPACK_DEBIAN_FILE_NAME DEB-DEFAULT)
  + set(CPACK_DEBIAN_PACKAGE_SHLIBDEPS YES)
  ```

  `CPACK_DEBIAN_FILE_NAME` will set the package name to follow the standard package naming scheme (see slides) and `CPACK_DEBIAN_PACKAGE_SHLIBDEPS` set to `YES` will (try to) extract the dependencies automatically. We can also set dependencies manually (`CPACK_DEBIAN_PACKAGE_DEPENDS`).

- Afterwards there will be no more complaint as the dependency list will be generated

  ```bash
  $ cpack -G DEB
  CPack: Create package using DEB
  CPack: Install projects
  CPack: - Run preinstall target for: HelloWorld
  CPack: - Install project: HelloWorld []
  CPack: Create package
  CPackDeb: - Generating dependency list
  CPack: - package: /mnt/cpack-example/build/helloworld_0.1.0_amd64.deb generated.
  ```

  We see that the package name was set to "${helloworld}" as lowercase names seem to be preferred.

- We can install the package

  ```bash
  sudo apt install ./helloworld_0.1.0_amd64.deb
  ```

  Files are installed in `/usr` now instead of `/usr/local`. That is the default target for Debian packages using the generator!

## 4. Check Debian package (Demo 2)

- The package already is usable. However, one might want to make sure that quality is good. If one wants to submit something to the actual repository of Ubuntu/Debian, then one has to follow the provided standards.
- If time permits we can checkout the contens of the package.
    - Inspect meta information

    ```bash
    dpkg --info helloworld_0.1.0_amd64.deb
    ```

    - Check full content

    ```bash
    dpkg-deb -R ./helloworld_0.1.0_amd64.deb ./helloworld-unpacked
    tree helloworld-unpacked
    ./helloworld-unpacked/
    ├── DEBIAN
    │   ├── control
    │   ├── md5sums
    │   ├── postinst
    │   └── postrm
    └── usr
        ├── bin
        │   └── helloworld
        ├── include
        │   └── sse
        │       └── sse.hpp
        └── lib
            ├── cmake
            │   ├── HelloWorldTargets-release.cmake
            │   └── HelloWorldTargets.cmake
            ├── libsse.so -> libsse.so.0.1.0
            └── libsse.so.0.1.0
    ```


- Check the package via `lintian`. (I need to do this on my host since I did not install lintian in the container).

  ```bash
  lintian helloworld_0.1.0_amd64.deb
  ```

- We observe quite some errors and warnings

  ```bash
  $ lintian helloworld_0.1.0_amd64.deb
  E: helloworld: changelog-file-missing-in-native-package
  E: helloworld: extended-description-is-empty
  E: helloworld: maintainer-name-missing firstname.lastname@example.com
  E: helloworld: no-copyright-file
  E: helloworld: package-must-activate-ldconfig-trigger usr/lib/libsse.so
  E: helloworld: unstripped-binary-or-object usr/bin/helloworld
  E: helloworld: unstripped-binary-or-object usr/lib/libsse.so
  W: helloworld: binary-without-manpage usr/bin/helloworld
  W: helloworld: maintscript-calls-ldconfig postinst
  W: helloworld: maintscript-calls-ldconfig postrm
  W: helloworld: package-name-doesnt-match-sonames libsse
  W: helloworld: shlib-without-versioned-soname usr/lib/libsse.so libsse.so
  ```

- Some things can be fixed easily by addin parameters to the CMake file

  ```diff
  + set(CPACK_PACKAGE_MAINTAINER "SSE lecturers")
  + set(CPACK_STRIP_FILES TRUE)
  ```

  `CPACK_PACKAGE_MAINTAINER` sets package maintainer and `CPACK_STRIP_FILES` make sure build files are stripped.

  Besides that one can add a changelog and a copyright file.
  `extended-description-is-empty` is requesting description of each component, i.e., the executable and the library. We do not provide information for each component at the moment.

- For some points it is harder to fix them
    - `package-must-activate-ldconfig-trigger`: Seems to be related how packages should be created and [CPack not respecting this yet](https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/cmake/-/issues/21834) (or I simply have an old version of CMake). CMake creates a maintainer script that calls `ldconfig` which should not be done anymore. Thus we get several error messages (1x ldconfig not called via trigger and 2x ldconfig called via maintainer script)
    - `shlib-without-versioned-soname`: No versioning of our library (e.g., `libsse.so -> libsse.so.0.1.0`) thus `shlib` cannot safely determine dependencies for software depending our library.
