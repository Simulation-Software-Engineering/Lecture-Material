## What is a Container?

<img src="https://github.com/Simulation-Software-Engineering/Lecture-Material/blob/main/02_virtualization_and_containers/figs/container-sketch.png" width=30%; style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; padding-top: 25px; padding-bottom: 25px">

- Container operates in "fenced off" part of the operating system (`namespaces`)
- Low(er) overhead than virtual machines
    - Runs on kernel (and libraries) of the host OS
    - Cheap to start and stop a container
- Available features depend on Host
    - Linux container on Windows or vice versa?
- Container can be isolated.

---

## Common Use-Cases

- Microservices
- Reproducible environments for developing and testing (DevOps)
- Container hype strongly driven by [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).
- More and more in science
    - High-performance computing, "Bring Your Own Environment" (BYOE)
    - Reproducible research

---

## Container Solutions

- Plenty of different container formats
    - [lxc/lxd](https://linuxcontainers.org/), [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), [Singularity](https://sylabs.io/), [podman](https://podman.io/), [Sarus](https://user.cscs.ch/tools/containers/sarus/)...
- Different solutions with different strengths due to different use cases
    - (Super-)Userspace
    - Direct access to hardware (memory, storage, GPUs) vs. encapsulation
    - Generic or with integration in software ecosystem (e.g. schedulers)
- Effort to establish certain standards
    - [Open Container Initiative (OCI)](https://opencontainers.org/)

## Security

- Docker considers itself safe

    > Applications are safer in containers and Docker provides the strongest default isolation capabilities in the industry

    - But so do most others
- Read the manual
- Are third-part containers trust worthy?
    - There have been cases [of malicious images](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/fr/security/news/virtualization-and-cloud/malicious-docker-hub-container-images-cryptocurrency-mining)
- Containers isolation from Host depends on container framework
- Think about **what** you do, **before** you do it

---

## Summary

- Shares many similarities with VMs, but
    - Lightweight alternative to VMs
    - Stricter limitations than VMs
- Many different containers solutions
    - Standardization effort
    - Choose right container for your use case

**Note**: Do not (only) use containers for shipping your software. Not everyone can run/use them.
