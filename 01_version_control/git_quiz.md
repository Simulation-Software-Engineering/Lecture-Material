# Git Quiz

Questions are taken from [py-rse](https://merely-useful.tech/py-rse/index.html), [learn.co](https://learn.co/lessons/git-github-learn-quiz), [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/quiztest/quiztest.asp?qtest=GIT), [this gist from @aspencer8111](https://gist.github.com/aspencer8111/17a80fb0a2be7b4718237fe8caa6e09c), and [codercrunch](https://www.codercrunch.com/quiz/take/1650218502/git-branching).

## Add & Commit I

Which command(s) below would save changes to myfile.txt to a local (already existing) Git repository? (multiple choice)

- `git commit -m "Add recent changes"`
- `git init myfile.txt` && `git commit -m "Add recent changes"`
- `git add myfile.txt` && `git commit -m "Add recent changes"`
- `git commit myfile.txt -m "Add recent changes"`

## Add & Commit II

Assume you made the following changes. What is the output of the last command in the sequence below?

```bash
touch motivation.txt
echo "Sharing information about myself." > motivation.txt
git add motivation.txt
echo "Documenting major milestones." > motivation.txt
git commit -m "Motivate project"
git restore motivation.txt
cat motivation.txt
```

- `Sharing information about myself.`
- `Documenting major milestones.`
- The following:

```
Sharing information about myself.
Documenting major milestones.
```

- An error message because we have changed motivation.txt without committing first.

## Create Branch I

What is the command to create a new branch named `add-feature-x`?

- `git add branch add-feature-x`
- `git branch new add-feature-x`
- `git branch add add-feature-x`
- `git branch add-feature-x`

## Create Branch II

What is the difference between `git branch add-feature-x` and `git checkout -b add-feature-x`?

- They do the same thing.
- The second command creates a copy of a remote branch while the first command branches from the current local branch.
- They both create a new branch "add-feature-x". However, the first command stays at the current branch while the second directly changes to the new branch.
- The first command creates a new branch. The second command changes to "add-feature-x" if the branch already exists.

## Merge Branches

How can you merge `add-feature-x` into `main`?

- `git merge add-feature-x main`
- `git merge main add-feature-x`
- `git checkout main` && `git merge add-feature-x`
- `git checkout add-feature-x` && `git merge main`

## Delete Branches

What is the command to delete the branch "add-feature-x"?

- `git delete add-feature-x`
- `git rm add-feature-x`
- `git delete branch add-feature-x`
- `git branch -d add-feature-x`

## Add Remote

What is the command to add the remote repository `https://ab.c/d/e.git` as "origin"?

- `git remote add origin https://ab.c/d/e.git`
- `git origin=https://ab.c/d/e.git`
- `git add origin https://ab.c/d/e.git`
- `git remote https://ab.c/d/e.git`

## Pull

`git pull` is a combination of:

- `git fetch` and `git merge`
- `git fetch` and `git rebase`
- `git fetch` and `git update`
- `git fetch` and `git checkout`

## Undo I

To unstage a currently staged file called `octocat.txt` without losing the changes, the git command is? (multiple choice)

- `git reset --soft octocat.txt`
- `git reset octocat.txt`
- `git checkout HEAD octocat.txt`
- `git restore --staged octocat.txt`

## Undo II

You made changes to a shell script called `data_cruncher.sh`, which broke it. Which of the git commands recovers the last committed version of the script? (multiple choice)

- `git checkout HEAD`
- `git checkout HEAD data_cruncher.sh`
- `git checkout HEAD~1 data_cruncher.sh`
- `git checkout <unique ID of last commit> data_cruncher.sh`
- `git restore data_cruncher.sh`
- `git restore HEAD`

## Undo III

How can you create a commit that undoes the changes of some other commit?

- `git undo`
- `git reset`
- `git checkout`
- `git revert`

## Clean

What does `git clean` do?

- Remove all untracked files except ignored ones
- Remove all ignored files
- Unstage everything
- Delete all commits that are not pushed yet

## Detached HEAD

What can cause you to enter a "detached HEAD" state?

- `git clean`
- Checking out a commit that doesn't have a branch pointing to it
- Cloning a bare repository
- Finishing a merge

## Delete Remote Branch

How can you delete a branch in a remote repository?

- `git push delete branchName`
- `git push origin --delete branchName`
- `git rm --push branchName`
- You can only do this through the web interface of the remote (e.g. GitHub)
