# Testing and CI

Learning goals:

- What is the relevance of testing simulation software.
- What are the concepts of unit testing, integration testing and regression testing and how to write such tests for a simulation software.
- How to use the Python testing frameworks `pytest` and `unittest` to generate a automated testing workflow.
- What continuous methodologies are.
- Why to automate common workflows.
- What are common workflows to automate.
- How to automate common workflows with ...
    - GitHub Actions.
    - GitLab CI/CD.
- How to use `Boost.Test` to write simple tests for C++ toy codes.
- What general concepts of test frameworks such as fixtures or decorators are.
- How tests can be called from CMake via CTest.
- How unit and integration tests look like for preCICE as an example of a real simulation software.
- How `Boost.Test`, CMake, and GitHub Actions work together for preCICE as an example of a real simulation software.
