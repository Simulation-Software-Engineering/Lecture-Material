# Building and Packaging

Learning goals:

- What is code packaging and which technologies are available to package code
- How is Python code packaged for uploading to PyPI and installation with pip
- How are software packages providedvia common packaging approaches (pip, apt, npm)
- How are software packages provided for high-performance computing (Spack, EasyBuild)

## Survey

| Duration | Format | Material |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 10 minutes | poll | [packaging_quiz.md](https://github.com/Simulation-Software-Engineering/Lecture-Material/blob/main/building-and-packaging/packaging_quiz.md) |

- Conduct an online poll with four questions to get an impression of how much the students already know about packaging
- Discuss results and quantify the minimum knowledge level of the class
