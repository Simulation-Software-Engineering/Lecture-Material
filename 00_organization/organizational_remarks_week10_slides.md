## Challenge Step 3: Suggestions

- Heterogeneous field: from *"already did good contributions"* to *"not really started"*
- If we think you are doing good, we will not interfere much, but you can of course always ask for input.
- A few have not yet opened an issue in the challenge repo (deadline was Dec 18). Please get in touch with your adviser asap.
- In general, please use the issue to keep us posted about any updates.
