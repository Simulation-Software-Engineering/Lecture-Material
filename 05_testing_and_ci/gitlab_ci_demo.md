# Demo: GitLab Runner

Test code in [automation lecture repository](https://gitlab-sim.informatik.uni-stuttgart.de/simulation-software-engineering-wite2223/lecture-automation) on our GitLab instance

## Inspect Repository

- Same code as for GitHub Actions, but now `gitlab-ci.yml` instead of `.github/workflows/...`
- Look at `gitlab-ci.yml`:
    - Does the same things as GitHub actions
    - Runs on a Docker image `ajaust/automation-lecture`
- Self-hosted GitLab instance: where should the CI run?
- Click on CI symbol of latest commit: pipeline is stuck
- Click on job: "doesn't have any runners"
- Edit in pipeline editor -> Visualize
- Settings -> CI/CD -> Runners -> Specific runners
    - URL and Token; we will need this in a minute

## Inspect bwCloud

- bwCloud: many services academia in BW can use; e.g. VMs
- Go to dashboard: https://portal.bw-cloud.org/ and login with Uni Stuttgart account
- I have already set up a VM. What I did:
    - Add public SSH key
    - Instances -> Launch instance
        - Ubuntu 22.04
        - Flavor: m1.small
    - `sudo apt update && sudo apt -y upgrade`
    - `sudo apt install -y docker.io`
- VM is up and running, connect to it: `ssh ubuntu@<IP>`

## Setup GitLab Runner

- Install GitLab Runner via Docker:

  ```bash
  sudo docker run -d --name gitlab-runner --restart always \
           -v /srv/gitlab-runner/config:/etc/gitlab-runner \
           -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
           gitlab/gitlab-runner:latest
  ```

    - `docker run -d --name gitlab-runner --restart always` runs the container in the background (`-d` means detached) names it `gitlab-runner` and makes sure that it always runs. The container is automatically restarted once it stops/crashes. If you want to stop the container, you have to stop it manually (`docker container stop`).
    - `-v /srv/gitlab-runner/config:/etc/gitlab-runner` mounts the directory `/srv/gitlab-runner/config` into the container.
    - `-v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock` mounts important Docker files into the container such that the container can start other containers (for pipelines).
    - `gitlab/gitlab-runner:latest` is the GitLab Runner image used from Docker Hub.
    - Summary: We start a manager Docker container (called runner) that will handle the jobs

## Register Runner

- `sudo docker run --rm -it -v /srv/gitlab-runner/config:/etc/gitlab-runner gitlab/gitlab-runner register`
    - URL: `https://gitlab-sim.informatik.uni-stuttgart.de/`
    - Token: see above
    - Description: `SSE Automation Demo Runner`
    - No tags, no maintenance note
    - Executor: `docker`
    - Default Docker image: `alpine:latest` (used for pipelines that do not specify any Docker image themselves, can be overwritten in configuration of pipeline)
- `sudo vi /srv/gitlab-runner/config/config.toml`
- Verify that there is now a runner in the repo settings
- Verify that pipeline now ran
