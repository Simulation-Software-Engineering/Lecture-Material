# Your Challenge: Contribute to Real Simulation Software

---

## Schedule

1. Pick a large-scale open-source simulation software (till **Oct 28**, evening)
2. Present the software: how you got it, what are main features, some tutorials you did, ... (**Nov 11**)
3. Present *"RSE infrastructure"* of the software: Which CI / documentation / building / git workflow ... does it use? How do contributions work? (**Dec 16**)
4. Contribute something small (but not trivial) to the software (*"good first issue"*). Run through complete contribution cycle (issue, discussion, PR, review, merge). Present what you did. Examples: feature, tutorial, documentation, support of new packaging tool, bugfix, ... (**Feb 10**)

Rough workload / grading weights: 25%, 25%, 50%

## Which Software to Pick?

* Something in the simulation universe (this includes equation solvers, meshing, scientific visualization, ...)
* Truly open source, all development in public
* Uses Git
* Written in Python or C++ (not a strict must)
* Real community project (not 1-2 PhD students developing, but multiple research groups behind project)
* A project that is open for contributions (`CONTRIBUTING.md` or similar)
* Ideally a software you have not worked with before (if you have, please discuss with us)
* Ideally, everybody picks something different

---

## How to Submit my Choice?

* [https://gitlab-sim.informatik.uni-stuttgart.de/simulation-software-engineering/challenge](https://gitlab-sim.informatik.uni-stuttgart.de/simulation-software-engineering/challenge)
* Comment in issue [#1](https://gitlab-sim.informatik.uni-stuttgart.de/simulation-software-engineering/challenge/-/issues/1) till **28th of October** (next Thursday) evening (no FCFS)
* Priority list with at least three choices
* If not on our suggestion list, write short paragraph what the software does and give links

---

## Role of Advisor

* Alexander or Benjamin
* Use exercise blocks and time after lectures for discussions
  * We both attend all lectures and labs
* Discuss at least what you plan to contribute
* Share links etc. to issues and PRs (or tag us)

---

## Presentations

* Length depends on students in course (maybe 5-10 mins for first two presentations, 10-20 mins for last)
* Everybody should learn something from every presentation
* Style: like a presentation in a team meeting, not like a presentation at a conference

---

## Reports

* Please also submit a report for each presentation
* 1-2 pages (2500-5000 chars)
* Written in markdown
* Submission via a merge request to the [GitLab challenge repo](https://gitlab-sim.informatik.uni-stuttgart.de/simulation-software-engineering/challenge)
* Add links, instructions, ... should work like a compact summary for everybody in the end
* Will be visible to everybody in SSE group
