# Organizational Things Week 7

---

## Poll on First 5 Weeks (1/2)

- Thanks for participating!
- Many wrote that they liked the concept. Made us very happy. :blush:
- **Multiple sources of content (website, GitLab, GitHub)**
    - We are aware of the problem and are thinking about solutions.
    - Reason 1: you should learn GitLab + GitHub
    - Reason 2: private information (GitLab) vs. public information (GitHub)
        - We need privacy for some things. We want public domain for other things.
    - In general: lecture on GitHub, challenge on GitLab

## Poll on First 5 Weeks (2/2)

- **Exercises too much workload**
    - How much time do you still need at home to finish?
    - You are not expected to finish within the exercise session (50% done is good).
    - Ask for help! Also through draft PRs.
- **Git exercise and VM/containers lecture need improvement** -> YES
- Demo challenge presentation by lecturers?
    - We are thinking about it.
    - What do you hope to learn exactly?
